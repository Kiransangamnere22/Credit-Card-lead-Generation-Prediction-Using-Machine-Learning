## Credit-Card-lead-Generation-Using-Machine-Learning

### About The Dataset:
#### In this project or case, the bank wants to cross-sell its credit cards to its existing customers.the bank has identified a set of customers that are eligible for taking these credit cards
#### This dataset is taking from "KAGGLE"

### Problem Statement:
#### TO predict which individuals or groups of people are most likely to apply for a credit card in "NEAR FUTURE" 

### Project Aim: 
#### The aim of this prediction is to identify potential customers who are more likeye to be intersted in credit card. In this project i used "FOUR" machine learning algorithm and check which algorithm perform well on this data.

### The algorithms are used.
#### 1.Logestic Regression
#### 2.Decision Tree
#### 3.Random Forest
#### 4.Ada boost Classifer

### Final conculsion: 
#### As we see that all models gives realtively same accuracy_score but the "DECISION TREE" model is having high accuracy score as compared to all other models... so we consider "DECISION TREE" model for this data set
